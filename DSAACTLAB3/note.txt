make a c++ code 

1st task: create an integer array composing of 10 elements with values ranging from 20-60 (unsorted)
display using for loop the original content of this array.

2nd task: create a container stack and queue and store the initial content of this array. Use insert function. Pop 3 times in both containers
Display content of stack and queue. Verify whether array has something in it or not.

3rd task: Merge the remaining content of the stack and queue into one container. Stack elements first the elements of the queue. Print the result after. Make it a void function that can be called.
3rd task: pagsamahin ang content ng stack and queue sa isang lalagyanan (14 elements). Stack first then queue. (Data Merging). print result.

4th task: Gumawa ng 4 na sorting algotrithm functions na pwede tawagin. 
Create 4 sorting algorithms that will sort the merged array and make them a function that can be called

5th task: Dito daw papasok ang chrono function. Between running the 4 sorting algorithm, monitor the time complexity of chosen sorting
algorithm. Print the output labels.

Using chrono function, monitor the time complexity of each sorting algorithms in ms. Print all the labels and data needed in the terminal
